3wdd - Optimize encryption logic: CFB/OFB/CTR padding is not required.(done)

3wdd - Optimize encrypt codes, now with a Blowfish-ctr method, tunnel data transfer performance
       is closed to raw non-encrypt tunnel. I believe that with a intel AES-NI supported CPU
       (like XEON E3-1240/1270), AES-128-CTR can also do it.(done)

3nsd - GeoIP based name resolving.(src ip based geo resolving done)

3wdd - check_3wd() var: _fixed_metric bug fix.(done)
