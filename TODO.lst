      UDT & TUN handling loop major rewrite, cpu consumption rate decrease 0.6%
      
      now UDT tunnel performing 50%-60% speed of direct TCP connection(with ZetaTCP)
      and package lost rate remaining below 0.6%(while direct connection has 1.4%-3%)
      (CN-US WAN link with 150ms-250ms latency, through the always-jammed CUCN submarine cable)
      
      however, UDT tunnel beats normal TCP connection(without ZetaTCP), with 30%-50% outperforming (v)
      (Test link like above)
